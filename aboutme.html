			<h2>Nick Janke</h2>
			<p><img id=nickpic src="bio.jpg">I am 27 years old born in Farmington Minnesota. I graduated as the class of 09 and joined the Army soon after. I spent 4 years in the Army in the infantry,
			with one deployment to Afghanistan in 2011, got out after my contract was done to pursue a high paying job and get my college degree. Currently I work at
			General Dynamics Mission Systems as a software engineer, working mostly in C, C#, and Python.
			I have been married for 5 years now and have a three year old son. 
			I am on my senior year of college and cannot wait for it to be over so my job stops paying me lower wages.</p>

			centering of map on user search. AQ Platform API was used to locate air quality measurements from various stations based on map location (Center and radius of map).
			Vue was used for more simple data aquisitioning and rendering throughout the program. The Leaflet head API was used for creating a heatmap based off measurements
			that were taken from the air quality API.
